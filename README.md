# Machine Learning Classifiers

This repository contains implementation and examples of various machine learning classifiers for predictive modeling. The following classifiers are included:

1. **Naive Bayes**
2. **Decision Tree**
3. **Random Forest**
4. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
5. **K-means**
6. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

Each classifier is implemented using different python libraries mentioned in the respective jupyter notebooks.
